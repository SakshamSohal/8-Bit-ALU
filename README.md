# 8-Bit-ALU
Overview:
- Developed an 8-bit ALU capable of performing essential arithmetic and logical operations.
- Simulated and verified the ALU design using Xilinx Vivado Testbench.
- Generated and analyzed simulation waveforms in Xilinx Vivado to verify ALU operations.
- Generated the RTL schematics for hardware-level visualization.
- Performed static timing analysis (STA).
- Generated the bitstream file ready for FPGA deployment.

 ALU Functionalities & Features:
- Operations Supported: Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, Left Shift, Right Shift.
- Flag Registers: Carry and Zero detection.
- Ready for implementation on Nexys A7 FPGA using XDC pin assignments.
- Bitstream successfully generated and programmed onto the FPGA.
- Real-time testing conducted using FPGA switches and LEDs.
